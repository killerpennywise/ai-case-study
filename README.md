# OpenAI

## Overview and Origin

**OpenAI** was founded in San Francisco, California in 2015 by a group of scientists and 
professionals. Which were comprised of Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, 
Elon Musk, Ilya Stutskever, Peter Thiel and others. [(Verostek,"Artificial Intelligence AI: OpenAI Company")](https://libguides.esf.edu/c.php?g=1309319&p=9625954#:~:text=The%20organization%20was%20founded%20in,collectively%20pledged%20US%241%20billion.). The idea for **OpenAI** came about due to the 
"founders' existential concerns about the potential for catastrophe resulting from 
carelessness and misuse of general-purpose AI." [(Hashemi-Pour,"OpenAI")](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/OpenAI#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20founded%20by,misuse%20of%20general%2Dpurpose%20AI.). **OpenAI** is a 
non-profit organization that subsists mainly off of donations, to-date **OpenAI** has 
received funding from multiple sources including but not limited to Sam, Greg, Elon, 
Reid, Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Theil, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, 
and YC Research which cumalitively adds up to roughly $1 billion. [(Brockman and Sutskever, "Introducing OpenAI")](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai).

## Business Activities

**OpenAI's** mission statement or specific problem that they are tackling is to ensure 
that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. [(Altman, "Planning for AGI and beyond")](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond). Their general consumer/customer is comprised mostly 
at the Enterprise level across multiple industries, which can range from the 
Information Technology and Services sector to the Telecommunications sector. [(Enlyft,"Companies using OpenAI")](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/openai). However, FE Digital Currency states in the 2023 **OpenAI** 
surpassed the one billion dollar mark reaching roughly $1.6 billion in revenue.[(FE Digital Currency,"OpenAI clocked $1.6 billion worth revenue in 2023")](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/digital-transformation-openai-clocked-1-6-billion-worth-revenue-in-2023-3355681/). This may be 
due to the competitive advantage that **OpenAI** offers with its products (ChatGPT 3, 
DALL-E, and more). According to Vedraj,
>**OpenAI** provides a competitive advantage by enabling quicker decision-making through data analysis, rapid content generation, and efficient customer service. This ability allows businesses to respond to market changes and customer demands swiftly. 
[(Vedraj,"Leveraging OpenAI In Business: Strategic Benefits And Practical Uses")](https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ai-ml/openai-in-business-benefits-and-uses/). 
Which makes the average person wonder, 
"what kind of technology can make such an advantage possible?" Simply, access to 
application and data services like Cloudfare, Amazon Web Services, Amazon 
Cloudfront, and Prism lay the groundwork for such an accomplishment. [(Stackshare,"Openai.com")](https://stackshare.io/openai/openai-com).

## Landscape

The field most associated with **OpenAI** is AI research and deployment. A field that 
has seen major trends and innovations over the last five to ten years, such as:
* *Generative AI* - Which leverages machine learning to create original output based 
on patters from existing training data.
* *Multimodal AI models* - Models that can "translate" text to images, images to 
videos, text to audio, and so forth.
* *Democratization* - Meaning to make something available and accessible to everyone.

Being seen as a huge success story in the startup world, **OpenAI** is sure to have a 
few competitors to look out for. Some of which are comprised of the following: 
* *Anthropic*
* *Mistral AI*
* *ElevenLabs*
* *Bria*
* *Sakana AI*
* *AI Redefined*
* *AI21 Labs*
* *Aleph Alpha*
* *01.AI*

## Results

**OpenAI** has had a significant business impact as a company, of which one of the most 
significant areas **OpenAI** has affected is natural language processing. Due to 
**OpenAI's** ChatGPT-3, a language model that understands and generates human-like text. 
Which can be used in a variety of applications with their API. [(Jacobs,"The Impact of OpenAI on business")](https://medium.com/@tobiasjacobs/the-impact-of-openai-on-business-50f8467130a4). While this certainly can be attributed to their success as 
a company there are other metrics to determine OpenAI's success. 
Metrics such as:
* *Gross profit margin*
* *Return on investment (ROI)*
* *Productivity*
* *Total number of customers*
* *Recurring Revenue*

For example,comparing **OpenAI** to its competitors, they are doing quite well with a 
recent revenue of over $1 billion. **OpenAI** is sitting among giants like Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, 
and a lesser known company Anthropic. These companies have revenue in the billions, 
so **OpenAI** is not far behind. [(Keary,"10 Companies With Largest AI Revenues: Success Cases from OpenAI, Anthropic & More")](https://asana.com/resources/success-metrics-examples).

## Recommendations

Looking forward, **OpenAI** would greatly benefit developing an AI Software Engineer 
(SWE) similar if not better than the recently announced **Devin**. [(Cognition-Labs,"Introducing Devin")](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin). This would be greatly beneficial to **OpenAI** as it would automate some if not all tasks a SWE is assigned, which would reduce time commitment say on code review or more general tasks such as continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD). Allowing the software engineers the freedom to focus on more vital tasks like solutioning and design. In order to implement such an endeavor we would need utilize machine learning frameworks such as TenserFlow or PyTorch. [(Kulkarni,"Exploring Devin AI: A Revolutionary Step in AI-Powered Software Development")](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-devin-ai-revolutionary-step-ai-powered-varun-kulkarni-zcmwc/). Along with a large data set to train the modeuls on, which may include terminal commands, scripts of various coding languages, etc.
These technologies are necessary in order to properly train and develop an AI software engineer just as a base.
